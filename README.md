# FinOps Foundation SIG Capabilities

Primary Authors: John McLoughlin

Reviewed and Contributed to by: tbc

# Introduction

SIG-Capabilities exists to explore and define the actions FinOps practitioners can take to both create change and measurement the effectiveness of that change across their technology environments. 

# Mission Statement



1. **Clarify and inform.** Provide valuable and objective information to the TAC, End Users and Projects of the FinOps Foundation regarding areas considered in-scope. Strengthen the project ecosystem to meet the needs of end users and project contributors. Educate and inform users with unbiased, effective, and practically useful information.
2. **Collaborate and interrelate.** Effectively interface with other related groups internal and external to the FinOps Foundation and connect the dots to facilitate meaningful collaborative progression of relevant topics. Engage more communities and create an on-ramp to effective TAC contribution &amp; recognition.
3. **Assist and attract projects.** Helping to maintain the continued health of FinOps Foundation capabilities-related definitions. Focus attention and resources on helping foster project maturity, systematically across FinOps Foundation projects. Clarify relationship between projects, FinOps Foundation project staff, and community volunteers. Identify gaps in the landscape of FinOps Foundation capabilities definitions. Find and attract projects to fill these gaps through invitation to present, diligence on proposed projects, and in essence, act as a funnel for TAC project reviews in this area.
4. **Afford impartial stewardship.** Provide and maintain a vendor neutral venue for relevant thought validation, discussion, and project feedback. Establish procedures to assist where necessary.

## In Scope

Definition of new capabilities as they pertain to driving better utilization of technology. Examples of this include:
Inform: Tag Strategy, Spend to Business mapping, Budgets & Forecasts, Custom Rates & Amortizations, Scorecards with KPIs, Benchmarks with Peers, Trending and Variance Analysis
Optimize: Remove Underutilized Resources, Visualize Spend/Usage, Identify Anomalies, Rightsizing, Workload Management, Automation
Operate: Utilize Marketplace, License Optimization, Balance Usage by Rate, Select Discounting Vehicles, Pre-purchase Capacity, Tiered Usage Discounting, Communucations Strategy, Decision Frameworking, Ongoing Review  

Definition of measurements associated with deriving the rate of value produced by making changes in technology. Examples of this include: 
KPIs by Usage: Cost per user, cost per API call
KPIs by Savings: Effective savings rate, effective usage rate
